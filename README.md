# routterCircuit
This circuit replicates the functioning of circular roulette wheel.

The roulette wheel consists of certain numbers arranged circularly and each person who plays the game has to bet a certain amount against any number he/she chooses. One person need to touch a pair of touch contacts provided at the left side of circuit. Then the LEDâ€™s rotate for some time and come to halt at a random number. The persons who bet money on the number at which the LED stops will get all the amount that has been bet by everyone who played that particular game.
